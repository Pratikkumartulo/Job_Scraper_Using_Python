# Job_Scraper_Using_Python
This Python-based job scraper collects job listings from LinkedIn, TimesJobs, and FreshersWorld using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. Users input a job title and location, and the scraper retrieves relevant postings. The data is organized into a table and exported as an Excel file, making it easy to analyze job opportunities.
